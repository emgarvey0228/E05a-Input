#E05a-Input
Game Technology Input Assignment. In this Godot exersize, I learned how to create inputs and actions. By adding in command inputs such as up, down, left, and right, I was able to asign keys to each input to start a command. By assigning keys, the spaceship now moves with the press of the W,A,S, or D key.
